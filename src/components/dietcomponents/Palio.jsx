        <Title>The Paleo Diet</Title>
        <IntroText>
          A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might
          have been eaten during the Paleolithic era, which dates from
          approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago. A paleo diet typically
          includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds â€” foods
          that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering.
